                My most ambitious project so far in my design career. To redesign the most crucial part

                The challenge on the app was to help the user with as much information as possible on

                conscious decision, at the same time keeping in mind that this shouldn‚Äôt be long, tedious

                operator, the route, the service and data about each customers personal choices. The 
                existing app did not showcase this effeciently. The challenge included showcasing this

            At my short stint in Sportskeeda (one of the largest sports news websites in the world 
                which gets more than <b>160 million</b> page views/month, reaching out to <b>45 million</b> unique 
                users every month) I was fortunate enough to re-design their user management 
                <b>dashboard</b>, create a medium like <b>editor</b> (sportkseeda has about <b>5000 writers</b> on its 
                platform) and create a <b>concept</b> for their main website.</div>

            was a common feeling among writers at Sportskeeda that they don‚Äôt feel they work for 
            a ‚Äòpremium‚Äô sports news company when they pen their thoughts on CK editor. Hence,
            there was a need for a fresh, modern looking, almost Medium-esque editor.</div>

            <div>The editor has 2 modules: one for the writers who write and send the articles to the 
            main editors (or moderators) who check the article for errors and mistakes and then
            publish it on the site. This is where the challenge lied, to simultaneously design a 
            dashboard for the editors to keep track of articles sent to them.</div></div>`
