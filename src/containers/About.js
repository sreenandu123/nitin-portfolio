        I am a user experience designer and I 
believe in ‘selfless design’, where users 
care more about the outcome of using a 
product than being affected by design.

Well, with that being said I love to create 
products that users take pleasure in using. 
I thrive in conditions where there are new
unsolved problems to solve and to work
on projects where design takes the 
front seat.

When I’m not designing you can find me
working on my motorcycle, strumming the 
guitar or doodling caricatures.
